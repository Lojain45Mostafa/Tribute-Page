    <h1>Jordan Peterson</h1>
    <p>Jordan Bernt Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist, YouTube personality, author, and a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. <br>

    <figcaption>Born and raised in Alberta, Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a PhD in clinical psychology from McGill University.
         After researching and teaching at Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 to permanently join the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, 
         Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures.
        The book combines psychology, mythology, religion, literature, philosophy and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and meaning.</figcaption>

 <h2 id="earlylife">Early Life</h2>
 <pre>
    Peterson was born on 12 June 1962, in Edmonton, Alberta, and grew up in Fairview, a small town in the northwest of the province.
He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson.
Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher.
His middle name is Bernt, after his Norwegian great-grandfather.
Peterson grew up in a mildly Christian household.

In junior high school, Peterson became friends with Rachel Notley and her family.
Notley became leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and the 17th premier of Alberta.
Peterson joined the New Democratic Party (NDP) from ages 13 to 18.
As a teenager, Peterson decided that "religion was for the ignorant, weak and superstitious" and hoped for a left-wing revolution, a hope that lasted until he met left-wing activists in college.</pre>

    <h2 id="Education">Education:</h2>
    <pre>After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature, studying to be a corporate lawyer. During this time he read The Road to Wigan Pier by George Orwell, which significantly affected his educational focus and worldview.
He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his BA in political science in 1982.
Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe, where he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War; 20th-century European totalitarianism; and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.
Peterson then returned to the University of Alberta and received a BA in psychology in 1984. In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his PhD in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.
While at McGill University and the Douglas Hospital, Peterson conducted research into familial alcoholism and its associated psychopathologies, such as childhood and adolescent aggression and hyperactive behaviour.</pre>

<h2 id="Career">Career:</h2>
<pre>From July 1993 to June 1998,[33] Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University, where he was hired as an assistant professor in the psychology department, later becoming an associate professor. 
During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse. An article in The Harvard Crimson said he possessed a "willingness to take on any research project, no matter how unconventional".
While at Harvard, he switched his primary area of research from familial alcoholism to personality and authored several academic papers.
Author Gregg Hurwitz, a former student of Peterson's at Harvard, has cited Peterson as an inspiration of his, and psychologist Shelley Carson, former PhD student and now-professor at Harvard, recalled that Peterson's lectures had "something akin to a cult following", stating, "I remember students crying on the last day of class because they wouldn't get to hear him anymore.
Following his associate position at Harvard, Peterson returned to Canada in July 1998 and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto.
Peterson's areas of study and research within the fields of psychology are psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational, religious, ideological, political, and creativity.
Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers and was cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017; at the end of 2020 almost 15,000 times.</pre>

<h3>Books</h3>
<h4><i>Maps of Meaning (1999)</i></h4>
<pre>According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why individuals and groups alike participate in social conflict, exploring the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification) that eventually result in killing and pathological atrocities such as the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp, and the Rwandan genocide.
Influenced by Jung's archetypal view of the collective unconscious in the book, Peterson says that an "analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality."</pre>
<h4><i>12 Rules for Life (2018)</i></h4>
<pre>In January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, in which self-help principles are discussed in a more accessible style than in his previous published work.
The book topped best-selling lists in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the US, and the United Kingdom.</pre>
